Assignment for the Reykjavik academy of web development .

In this project I utilized materialize CSS framework.

Using the framework made the process a lot faster and simpler.

I made two pages and had a video on the index page, while on the contact page i included a form to fill in.

I used Sassy CSS to make the CSS more readable.
